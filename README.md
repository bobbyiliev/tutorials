# Blog posts by me ðŸš€

The posts are automatically imported to my [DevDojo DevBlog](https://devdojo.com/bobbyiliev) every day.

## Required syntax

In order for the import to go through successfully you need to follow these steps here:

* Save your blog posts as `.md` files
* It is best to not have any spaces in the filename, a good example is: `how-to-build-a-crud-app.md`
* The file should have the following structure:

```
---

title: Your Post Title Here
tags: some,tags,separated,by,comma
image: https://cdn.devdojo.com/posts/images/June2021/how-to-limit-the-result-with-laravel-eloquent.jpg
status: published

---

# Introduction

Your post body here.

Make sure to use **Markdown**!
```

* If your post is a draft, set the status to `status: draft` rather than `published`.
